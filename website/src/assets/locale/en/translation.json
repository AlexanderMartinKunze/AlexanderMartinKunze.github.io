    "boservice-desc": "I developed advanced planning algorithms specifically designed for professional craftsmen. These algorithms utilize artificial intelligence to optimize routes, leading to significant time and cost savings. By analyzing traffic data, customer locations, and job priorities, I ensured that craftsmen could complete their tasks efficiently and on time.\n\nTo foster a flexible and iterative development environment, I applied the agile methodology ‘Scrum’. This approach allowed the team to quickly respond to changes and continuously improve. Through regular sprint planning, daily stand-up meetings, and retrospectives, we significantly enhanced team collaboration and communication.\n\nTo ensure software quality and reliability, I implemented test automation at all levels. This included end-to-end testing, unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing. By using automated testing tools and frameworks, we were able to detect and fix errors early, resulting in more stable and robust software.",
